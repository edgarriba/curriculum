%I have recently seen your advertisement in your website and I would therefore like to apply for a Ph.D. position in the Perceiving Systems Department.
%
%I am a student of the MSc in Automatic Control and Robotics at the UPC (Barcelona, Spain). I am currently finishing my master thesis graduating in June 2015. The MSc is focused on areas such as Mobile Robotics, Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, which are relevant for the position you are offering.
%
%During my studies I participated in some voluntary activities related to robotics like the EU project RoCKIn camp 2014 (Rome, Italy) and the HUMABOT Robot Competition during the 2014 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Madrid, Spain). In both projects I managed the perception and computer vision tasks along with the ROS middleware. During the following semester I am going to do an internship in Aldebaran Robotics (Paris, France) working on an Open Source object recognition toolbox with ROS in order to complement my masters thesis.
%
%I am a passionate and motivated contributor of the Open Source community since I participated in the Google Summer of Code 2014 where I was involved in the OpenCV project implementing a PnP method and developing an application for real time pose estimation for textured objects. For the past four months I have continued the project as my masters thesis at the Institut de Rob\`{o}tica i Inform\`{a}tica Industrial (Barcelona, Spain) implementing an extended method of the EPnP.
%
%The motivation to applying for this position is due to the fact that I am strongly interested in the areas of research your department is specialised. For instance, I read about the last works done by Dr. A. Geiger in \textit{3D Traffic Scene Understanding from Movable Platforms} and \textit{Multi-View Priors for Learning Detectors from Sparse Viewpoint Data}. I found it really stimulating and arouse my interest to collaborate with him in further projects. Working with Dr. A. Geiger would be a great opportunity for my career and it would give me the possibility to improve my skills in object recognition, machine learning and robotics areas. Finally, another point worth to be mentioned is the good working environment that seems to be in your office (I love Rocko picture), which also encourage me to apply for the Ph.D. position.
%
%%I obtained my BSc in Geomatics and Civil Surveying Engineering at the Universitat Polit\`{e}cnica de Catalunya(UPC) in 2008. I am currently studying an MSc in Automatic Control and Robotics at the UPC, graduate in January 2015. The subjects which I am studying are relevant to the post such as Mobile Robotics, Path Planning, Advanced Topics in Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning in addition to Human Robot Interaction.
%
%%For the past 6 months I have been preparing for the domestic service robots challenge of the EU project RoCKIn in collaboration with the UPC and PAL Robotics (Barcelona, Spain) using ROS along with the REEM robot platform. Moreover, I am participating in the HUMABOT Robot Competition during the International Conference on Humanoid Robots(Madrid, Spain) using ROS along with the NAO robot platform. In both projects I design and develop the code related to the perception tasks. Furthermore, I am working on my masters thesis at the Institut de Rob\`{o}tica i Inform\`{a}tica Industrial (Barcelona, Spain) implementing a method for Textured Objects Detection and Pose Estimation, which we plan to use in the aforementioned challenge.
%
%%I believe that I am a suitable candidate for this position, given my passion and constant curiosity to achieve hard goals related to solve mobile robotics, computer vision and machine learning problems. A reason which I think that hiring me will make your lives easier is the fact that this summer I was selected to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2014 in collaboration with the OpenCV organisation to contribute in the object detection field and in the new version release. I strongly support the premise that could be interesting for you having an expert team member who is used with this kind of Open Source libraries in order to develop perception algorithms and getting systems to really work.
%
%%Throughout this summer, I achieved many personal goals strengthening my experience in programming, computer vision and getting systems to really work.
%
%I hope that you will consider my application and please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
%
%I look forward to hearing from you.
